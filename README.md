Crates that don't exist, but should
===================================

A collection of [Rust] project ideas.

These are bite-sized ideas for which someone already has a mostly clear design
in mind. They are waiting on an interested library developer to carry through
the implementation and own the code. The requester should be prepared to offer
guidance on any API design questions that arise during implementation.

Ideas should result in their own useful library, even if that is just a few
functions. Ideas for which the code would go in some existing project should be
filed on that project's issue tracker rather than being listed here.

Many of these would make neat projects for a Rust novice.

To work on an idea, click through on one of the "Design" links to read more
about the idea and coordinate as you make progress on the library.

To add a project idea, please file an issue with enough detail so that anyone
interested can understand the design you have in mind. Include links to relevant
background material if possible. Then send a PR adding a link to your issue.
Feel free to add a new heading if none of the existing ones apply to your idea.
